# genfacture
Simple page to generate invoices in pdf format. It can be used offline. It uses Angular and jsPdf

The source code is not very lean but it does the trick. It is a proof of concept for a larger project where invoice generation is a feature.

Just create a folder under your web server un copy the files in it. No database is used neither backend technology. There is a counter stored in a file. 

## TODOS
- Clean the code
- Improve the invoice appearance
